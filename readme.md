# Pi Lang

> Note: This entire codebase was written in a week then I lost focus, code analysis is mostly working, but interpreting wasn't started. I have no clue how to even use this language and I am the one who made it. 

Pi lang is an array programming language, with a focus on usability.

## Example

```
arr int data:int[10](x)->(index x)
```

The example above would create an array of 10 elements where each element is a number from 0 to 9

# Building

Pilang does not currently have any dependencies, and currently uses the scons building system. Building is as easy as  doing:
```
scons .
```
